# "The N" Google Search
I was joking around about something and the idea of searching the internet for "The `N`", where `N` is some random number, came up. We did a couple and of course got some interesting hits. I wanted to see if you got something meaningful for a bunch of numbers. So here we are.

## Usage
Ensure Python 3 and Chrome (or some Chromium variant) is installed.

Clone this project, install required 3rd party packages, then run:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python the-n-google-search.py

Change how many searches are done by changing the `NUM_SEARCHES` variable in the file.
